## Depreciation

### What it is
Depreciation is the expense recorded for **tangible (physical) assets** as they are used over time.

### Examples
- Buildings 
- Machinery 
- Servers 
- Vehicles 
- Office equipment 

### Simple Example
- Machine cost: ₹10,00,000 
- Useful life: 10 years

Annual Depreciation = ₹1,00,000 per year

👉 The company spreads the asset cost over its useful life instead of expensing it all at once.
